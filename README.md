# dribbbleBOT.js is a console script that automatically likes dribbble shots.

1. Log in to dribbble
2. Get random shot
3. Copy script from dribbbleBOT.js (I mean the text, not whole file)
4. Paste in browser's console (in Chrome hotkey is F12)
5. Press enter

# dribbbleBOT gives a like and then move to the next shot. This process is repeated infinitely.
# Added new feature - if dribbbleBOT or you manually already liked current shot, it goes to the next shot.
